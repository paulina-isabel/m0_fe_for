# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I don't feel 100% with this lesson. I'm having to look at my notes more than usual.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I deifnitely felt the pressure. I had a good emount of unproductive struggle, but was able to stop myself from spiraling further. My productive struggle was relieved by talking through some of the challenge with classmates. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Definitely need to take some time after finishing this submission to build memory.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have some questions about how to find info more efficiently online. I plan on asking my classmates how they got there.
